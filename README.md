# Run your notebooks as-is on AzureML Service with MLOps extensions


We use MLOps to manually or automatically trigger builds due to Github PRs and changes.  The control plane is in DevOps and AzureML Service provides numerous capabilities to track your assets when running Jupyter notebooks local or in the cloud. 

## AzureML improves your MLOps experience!
